Recrutement task.

## Tech stack:

- typescript
- React
- Next.js (as boilerplate and mostly for routing and very easy deployment on Vercel)
- Tailwind

## Things to improve

- RWD
  - big screens (lists display only 10 elements)
  - improve small screen (adjust grid and tiles for example)
- fetching data (I was planning on adding react-query)
- add tests (no there are none)
- I left some comments in code

I used Tailwind since it was already nicely configured via next.js and to be honest, in real projects I wouldn't write css without any additional frameworks.
I didn't utilized full, server-side rendering, next posibilietes - could be improved if project was comercial.
There are no tests - no real excuse for that other than I have already spend big part of sunday on that task and want to chill a bit. If app would be commercial I would for sure add test.
